I am a PhD student at Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio) working at the [Computer Vision Lab - LVC](http://www.lvc.ele.puc-rio.br) under the supervision of [prof. Raul Queiroz Feitosa](https://scholar.google.com.br/citations?user=2unw_HYAAAAJ&hl=pt-BR). My research involves developing new techniques for semantic segmentation and object detection and tracking using satellite imagery.

I received my MSc. degree in Mathematical Modelling with focus on Data Science and Machine Learning from [Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV - Emap)](https://emap.fgv.br/) in 2019. Before that I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Instituto Militar de Engenharia (IME)](http://www.ime.eb.mil.br/en/) in 2016.

Some of my broad areas of interest are generative models and inverse problems,e.g. Super-Resolution and Semantic Segmentation. 

My current areas of application are Ship Detection, Oil spill detection and Land Cover/Land use change detection using SAR image data.
